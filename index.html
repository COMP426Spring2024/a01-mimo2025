    <p class="paragraph" id="paragraph"> Like most gods and goddesses in Ancient Mythology, the
         myth of Aphrodite’s creation has many versions and interpretations but 
         I will be explaining the goddess of love’s creation story according to 
         Homer’s, The Illiad. In this story, Aphrodite, the daughter of Zeus and 
         Hera, is portrayed as the main cause of the Trojan War and is also one 
         of Troy’s biggest supporters among the gods and goddesses. Although this 
         is the interpretation that all of The Love Diary’s content is based on, 
         I would like to share another commonly circulated version of Aphrodite’s 
         creation myth. In this alternate version, Aphrodite is the daughter of 
         Uranus and was created when Cronus, Zeus’s father, cut off the genitals 
         of his father, the Greek god of the sky, Ouranos, and threw them into the 
         sea, creating a seafoam in which Aphrodite originated from. These conflicting 
         tales, of Aphrodite’s creation, indicate that her origins are particularly 
         elusive. It seems as though Aphrodite was not native to early Greek religion
         and her character and mythologies have continued to develop over centuries.
